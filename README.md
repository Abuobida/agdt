The Advanced Game Developer's Toolkit
============

This is the code repository for the book [The Advanced Game Developer's Toolkit](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484210987).

There are two ways to access the source code: by downloading the ZIP file or by
cloning this repository.

The ZIP file
-----------

Select the *Clone or download* button and choose *Download ZIP*.

Clone this repository
---------------------

Alternatively, you can use Git to clone this repository. (If you don't
know how to use Git [you can find out
here](https://github.com/kittykatattack/learningGit).) 

To clone this repository, run the following in the command line:
```
git clone git@github.com:kittykatattack/agdt.git
```

Launching a web server
------------------

You'll need to launch a web server in the root repository directory. A
modern text editor like [Light Table](http://lighttable.com),
[Brackets](http://brackets.io) or [Atom](https://atom.io) will
launch one for you automatically, directly from the editor, when you
use it to open an HTML file in the browser. 

Or you could launch a web server directly from the command line using
[http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) or [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server). After the server starts, navigate to
`http://localhost:8080/` in your browser and you'll be able to
interact with working versions of all the example files in the book. 

Hexi
----

The game engine with which the example were built is called [Hexi](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi). For simplicity, only the `hexi.min.js` file has been inluded in this repository. For access to Hexi's current source code and details on how to use it, visit: https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi
